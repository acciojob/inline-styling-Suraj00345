	<p>Helping plants to grow and thrive has been proven to reduce stress. In fact, back in 2010, a much-cited scientific study found that simply walking in a forest (known in Japan as ‘shinrin-yoku’ or ‘forest bathing’) can lower your blood pressure and make you feel calmer. But did you know that consuming or applying certain herbs and flowers to your skin can successfully treat a host of common physical health problems, too?</p>

	<p>Although most people with hay fever are more allergic to grass, some cut flowers can also be a problem. Wind-pollinated flowers are usually the worst for hay fever, as their pollen is light and naturally breaks away from the plant very easily. On the other hand, flowers which are pollinated by insects tend to be much less irritating, as their pollen is heavy and sticky, and doesn't disperse around the home.</p>
